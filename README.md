# Godot Files

Provides syntax-highlighting for some Godot Editor files.  
This isn't meant to replace the [godot-tools] extension, but it has improvements on its supported files.

[godot-tools]: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-vscode-plugin

**Compatibility**: Godot 3.x, 4.0

## Features

Includes syntax-highlighting for these languages:

- Godot Shader files: `.gdshader`, `.gdshaderinc`
- Better (more specific) grammar for the INI-like files supported by Godot (Asset Properties Definition):  
  `.godot`, `.tscn`, `.escn`, `.tres`, `.gdns`, `.gdnlib`, `.import`, etc.
- The same grammar is reused for `.cfg` and the INI-like XDG Desktop Entry files: `.desktop`, `.directory`  
  You might want to associate this language (Configuration Properties) with other INI-like formats as well.

INI-like files also support:

- outline and breadcrumb items

INI-like Godot asset files also support:

- navigate to definition of Ext/Sub Resource references, and to resource paths
- hover image and font resource paths/references to preview them (only some formats are supported)
- hover resource references to show gdscript (pre)load code

Other features such as full hover documentation, etc., *might* be included eventually, but aren't as of now.

## Known Limitations

Parsing of INI-like files is very simplistic (line-based; doesn't use a robust parser library), but should work well for almost all cases where files were generated by Godot. A few corner cases might not match, specially if you manually edit files (e.g., a line with an array value like `[null]` may be interpreted as a section).

Embedded code (like gdscript/gdshader) in asset strings is syntax-highlighted, however:

- VSCode is not recognizing "embeddedLanguages" as expected for some reason (bug?), so things like toggling comments,
  snippets, etc. won't consider the embedded language's context.
