# Godot Files

Provides syntax-coloring for some files supported by Godot Editor.  
This is *not* meant to replace the [godot-tools] extension, but to improve on its supported files. This plugin can work alongside godot-tools, but it's independent and does not require it or Godot Editor to provide any functionality.

[godot-tools]: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-vscode-plugin

**Compatibility**: Godot 3.x, 4.0

## Features

Includes syntax-coloring for these languages:

- Godot Shader files: `.gdshader`, `.gdshaderinc`
- Better (more specific) grammar for the INI-like files supported by Godot (Asset Properties Definition):  
  `.godot`, `.tscn`, `.escn`, `.tres`, `.gdns`, `.gdnlib`, `.import`, `.remap`, etc.
- The same grammar is reused for `.cfg` and the INI-like XDG Desktop Entry files: `.desktop`, `.directory`  
  You might want to associate this language (Configuration Properties) with other INI-like formats as well.

INI-like files also support:

- Outline and breadcrumb items.

INI-like Godot Asset files also support:

- Navigate to definition of Ext/Sub Resource references, and to resource paths.
- Hover image and font resource paths/references to preview them (only some formats are supported).
- Hover resource references to show code for loading in GDScript (`preload(‚Ä¶)`, `load(‚Ä¶)`, `FileAccess.open(‚Ä¶)`).
- Syntax-coloring of embedded code in asset strings for GDScript and Godot Shader resources.

If you want **more features**, check the [section](#potential-future-development) below.

## Known Limitations

Parsing of INI-like files is very simplistic (line-based; doesn't use a robust parser library), but should work well for almost all cases where files were generated by Godot. A few corner cases might not match, specially if you manually edit files (e.g., a line with an array value like `[null]` may be interpreted as a section). Also, `ext_resource` paths containing comment chars (`#` or `;`) are not parsed properly in outline; this causes issues in hover too.

VSCode only recognizes a word token properly when hovering or placing the cursor within its first 32 characters. So, for long paths, you only get the tooltip when hovering this initial part of the path.

VSCode is not recognizing "embeddedLanguages" as expected for some reason, so, if you edit code inside GDAsset strings, then things like toggling comments, snippets, etc. won't consider the embedded language's context.

## Potential Future Development

You might have commercial interest in funding development of this extension or of a **specific feature** that you want. Or maybe you're a kind soul with the means to contribute for the benefit of the community.

In any case, [donating here] allows you the right to optionally **vote on a feature** and also send a special message. If there's enough funding from the community, development will start/progress, prioritizing the most voted/funded feature. Any amount helps a lot!
