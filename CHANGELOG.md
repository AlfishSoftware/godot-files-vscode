# Changelog
<!-- Types of changes: Security, Removed, Deprecated, Changed, Added, Fixed -->

Features currently in early access are marked with üîí as they're restricted to [supporters].  
Features previously in early access are marked with ***vX.Y.Z*** üîì as they're unlocked for everyone since that version.

### Fixed
- Stronger pattern to match files with more priority than other extensions like godot-tools.
